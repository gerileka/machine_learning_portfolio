This project is a part of a Quantitative Finance course (Panth√©on Sorbonne).

## Goals

The idea behind the project was the usage of ML prediction in portfolio construction and manage an active portfolio strategy.

We were given the task to create a portfolio given the equities and compare the results with a benchmark. The equities are US stocks categorized as ESG (aprox 50 tickers). The project will be separated in two main strategies, Long Only (LO) with the SPX as a benchmark and Long/Short benchmarked with Eonia +4%.


You could find our results in final_project.ipynb
